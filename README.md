# RetinaSegmentation-DL

**Retina Vessel Segmentation Project**

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning-based approach to segment retinal vessels using the RAVIR dataset.

## Project Overview

This study focuses on the early detection of retinal vascular changes, employing a U-Net variant named "RetinaSegmentor." The model achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.72 and a Dice coefficient of 0.823 on the RAVIR dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r code/requirements.txt`
2. Download the RAVIR dataset and place it in the `data/RAVIR/` directory.



## Usage

- Use the jubeter notebook in 'code/RetinaSegmentation.ipynb' to train and test the model.

## Results

Our model demonstrated exceptional performance, with a high mIoU and Dice coefficient, showcasing its potential for early detection of retinal vascular changes.
